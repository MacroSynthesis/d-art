     <p>D-Art aims to solve the trouble of the affordability of equipment which leads to the 
      hesitancy of pursuing the Creative Economy. Budget has become a problem when purchasing 
      equipment to pursue the Creative Economy as a career choice as this equipment can be 
      expensive to many. Among the top inquiries of Art students would be affordable equipment and 
      would go through lengths going through researching in different links and videos that would help 
      them decide, but D-Art can make it easier with having it all in one website with all the needed 
      information. Our Company can provide experienced reviews from people who have handled 
      certain equipment which are alternatives and cheaper than other products. Recommended brands 
      and equipment are posted and up to date whether you need gadgets, software, and arts and crafts. 
      Links for numerous online stores will be listed and news for sales and discounts will be posted 
      and notified. Not only would we provide the links for official stores, but we would have links for 
      secondhand equipment for a much more affordable price compared to the original.</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">
      <p>Having the best equipment can be an investment in pursuing a career, however the 
        problem lies whether one can buy it or not. The fear is present when people think of cheaper 
        equipment because commonly it would mean the quality of it is half-baked or problematic. The 
        company wishes to solve this problem by already having a list of recommendations on gadgets 
        with reviews of the equipment in its own website page. The reviews we give for each product 
        would include what to expect in the box, Pros and Cons in a descriptive and more detailed 
        manner, a summary of the pros and cons, the product to price ratio to see itâ€™s worth, and 
        additional information of the equipment. There will not be any ratings as it would hinder the 
        psychological thought process when choosing an equipment with the mentality that a higher 
        rating is better and needed.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br></p>
     <p>We understand that artists have different needs and have different standards when 
      choosing their equipment/materials. We do not advertise the products that would be shown on 
      the website and to try of persuading the buyer to purchase a specific equipment. The website 
      serves as a convenient guide to find what equipment the artist/buyer is looking for.</p>
