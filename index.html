              <p>
                Expensive Equipment has been an issue for new/limited artists who are having
                difficulties in purchasing it. The problem lies with finding alternatives as people would have to
                search widely and hard to choose the equipment they just need at an affordable price. D-art
                solves the issue by providing recommended equipment with its own reviews in its own
                respective page, all the necessary information to use as a guide in finding their equipment is all
                in one website. D-art also provides links of online stores for these equipment and news feed for
                any discounts/sales of certain items
              </p>

              <p>
                We have delicate care for our audience because we are also them, so we give them
                full freedom to choose their own equipment with the given reviews we have of them.
                Unlike other companies, we do not include ratings/a numerical value of the products
                as we understand that people have different needs and different circumstances.

              <p>
                VFX artists produce digitally generated imagery that is photoreal. The role calls for the seamless
                integration of these effects into live action in motion pictures, television, and, increasingly,
                internet and console gaming.
                The most recent technology is used by VFX artists to create computer-generated creatures,
                crowds, and stunt doubles. Digital particle effects, which can manipulate objects and lighting
                and include fluid and fire, are another expanding field.
                You must persuade the viewer that what they are witnessing is authentic. This might be a
                dragon, a castle from a fairy tale, a downpour, a large wave, a spaceship, a superhero, an
                extraterrestrial city, or a complete planet.

                Art directors oversee a team of creatives and make decisions on which artistic techniques to
                use, how to best portray the creative director's concept, how to assess and approve content,
                designs, or images, and how to develop budgets and timelines.
                Most businesses, both domestically and abroad, need at least a Bachelor's degree in art or
                design, as well as prior professional experience. Art directors may have previously worked as
                graphic designers, illustrators, copy editors, photographers, or any other art or design

                An Animator is in charge of creating a series of images known as frames that serve to show

                forms of entertainment.
                You can prepare for entry into the field by earning an HND (higher national diploma) or degree

    <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">
      It is observed in the graph that Art Directors accept any level of educational
      attainment of their employees. However, take note that more than half of the population
      graduated with a bachelors/master degree. Less than half are those who graduated
      with lower education. For Animators, VFX Artists, and Filmmakers, most of the population
      are associates or graduated with a bachelor's degree in their field.</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">
      This indicates that for some jobs you don’t have to have a bachelor’s degree in order to take on the job.
      Though having a bachelor’s degree is most preferable among all three choices. The Animators are the exception
      as the graph is shown.</p>

      <i>Comparison of Yearly Average Base Salary.</i>
    </h3>
    <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">It is noticeable that the Philippines
      has a relatively lower average salary in terms of the creative industries chosen. In the graph, it is
      shown that in the Philippines, Art Directors have the highest average income and Animators have the
      lowest. Ironically, Animators have the highest average income among the 3 countries chosen.</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In the US, it’s the Animators who
      got the highest and the VFX artists as the lowest income. While in Japan, it’s the Filmmakers who got
      the highest and Animators as the lowest income.</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">This shows that in each country,
      each jobs’ income is different and it should be taken into account if you consider getting jobs
      outside the country. It is also shown that Art Directors have a great paying grade in all three
      countries among the rest of the jobs. Their average salary is also relatively better than others.</p>

        Challenges
    </h3>

    <p>Headline: The Creative Economy could be your workplace
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br></p>
    <p>To promote the Creative Economy, is to promote transformation/evolution. When defining
      Creative Economy, there is no singular definition. It is a concept which builds and evolves from
      the interplay between human creativity and ideas and intellectual property, & knowledge and
      technology. It is essentially a knowledge-based economic activity. The Challenges in promoting
      the creative economy are many as it can have different perspectives and needs, but the focus
      would be COVID-19 and how it drives the creative economy to evolve again to counter said
      challenge.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br></p>
    <p>
      The creative economy can offer a practical development option, particularly for
      developing countries. Using intellectual and creativity capital, the production and distribution of
      goods and services are used as primary inputs. They consist of a collection of knowledge-based
      activities that result in the creation of both material things and immaterial intellectual or artistic
      services with creative content, monetary worth, and market objectives. However, a report states
      that the exportation of creative services of developing countries are underrepresented and faced
      hurdles. Furthermore, there is a significant difference in the creative trade gap between
      developed and developing countries. Other significant hurdles faced are COVID-19, climate
      change and environmental crisis, geopolitical tensions, and cost-of-living crisis. Despite the
      hurdles, the creative economy remains a critical sector for sustainable development.

    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br></p>
    <p>
      The biggest hurdle would be the COVID-19 pandemic as it slowed the progress of
      trading creative goods and services which resulted in unemployment. Most of the economy
      solely depends on freelancers, which is four times as many than those employed with formal
      roles. This poses a challenge to the promotion of the creative economy because no one would
      join an industry that is failing or in trouble especially in times of crisis. The adoption of
      digitalization could improve the creative economy by promoting technical innovation, boosting
      digital infrastructure, and facilitating digital transformation in associated industries. However,
      despite the adoption of technology, to avoid mass unemployment it is critical to cultivate creative
      abilities that cannot be replaced by technology. Although there is a problem with digitalization,
      and it would be the high cost of the digital equipment which could hinder the plans to adopt
      digitalization. The whole concept of digitization has been in progress for some decades and the
      availability of equipment can be solved with multiple companies developing and selling a
      multitude of products.</p>

      The creative economy can offer a practical development option towards developing
      countries by usings the distribution of goods and services via intellectual and creativity capital
      as primary inputs. However, the exportation of creative services of developing countries are
      underrepresented and faced challenges. Other hurdles found would be COVID-19,
      environmental crisis, geopolitical tensions, and cost-of-living crisis. Despite these, the creative
      economy remains a critical sector for sustainable development. The COVID-19 pandemic
      slowed the progress of trading creative goods and services which resulted in unemployment.
      Most of the economy depends on freelancers which numbered four times more than those
      formally employed. This poses a challenge to promote the creative economy because of its
      setbacks from the COVID-19. The adoption of digitalization could improve the creative economy
      by promoting technical innovation, boosting digital infrastructure, and facilitating digital
      transformation in associated industries. Despite the adoption of technology, to avoid mass
      unemployment it is critical to cultivate creative abilities that cannot be replaced by technology.
      The movement to digitalization would have high costs as the equipment itself is expensive given
      how relatively new they are, although the concept of digitalization has been in progress for
      some decades meaning multiple companies developed and are developing a multitude of
      products which can aid the movement to digitalization
