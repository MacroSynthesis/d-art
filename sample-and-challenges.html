      <p>Headline: The Creative Economy could be your workplace
      </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br></p>
      <p>To promote the Creative Economy, is to promote transformation/evolution. When defining
        Creative Economy, there is no singular definition. It is a concept which builds and evolves from
        the interplay between human creativity and ideas and intellectual property, & knowledge and
        technology. It is essentially a knowledge-based economic activity. The Challenges in promoting
        the creative economy are many as it can have different perspectives and needs, but the focus
        would be COVID-19 and how it drives the creative economy to evolve again to counter said
        challenge.</p>
       <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br></p>
       <p>
        The creative economy can offer a practical development option, particularly for
        developing countries. Using intellectual and creativity capital, the production and distribution of
        goods and services are used as primary inputs. They consist of a collection of knowledge-based
        activities that result in the creation of both material things and immaterial intellectual or artistic
        services with creative content, monetary worth, and market objectives. However, a report states
        that the exportation of creative services of developing countries are underrepresented and faced
        hurdles. Furthermore, there is a significant difference in the creative trade gap between
        developed and developing countries. Other significant hurdles faced are COVID-19, climate
        change and environmental crisis, geopolitical tensions, and cost-of-living crisis. Despite the
        hurdles, the creative economy remains a critical sector for sustainable development.
       </p>
       <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br></p>
       <p>
        The biggest hurdle would be the COVID-19 pandemic as it slowed the progress of
        trading creative goods and services which resulted in unemployment. Most of the economy
        solely depends on freelancers, which is four times as many than those employed with formal
        roles. This poses a challenge to the promotion of the creative economy because no one would
        join an industry that is failing or in trouble especially in times of crisis. The adoption of
        digitalization could improve the creative economy by promoting technical innovation, boosting
        digital infrastructure, and facilitating digital transformation in associated industries. However,
        despite the adoption of technology, to avoid mass unemployment it is critical to cultivate creative
        abilities that cannot be replaced by technology. Although there is a problem with digitalization,
        and it would be the high cost of the digital equipment which could hinder the plans to adopt
        digitalization. The whole concept of digitization has been in progress for some decades and the
        availability of equipment can be solved with multiple companies developing and selling a
        multitude of products.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br></p>
        <p>
          The creative economy can offer a practical development option towards developing
          countries by usings the distribution of goods and services via intellectual and creativity capital
          as primary inputs. However, the exportation of creative services of developing countries are
          underrepresented and faced challenges. Other hurdles found would be COVID-19,
          environmental crisis, geopolitical tensions, and cost-of-living crisis. Despite these, the creative
          economy remains a critical sector for sustainable development. The COVID-19 pandemic
          slowed the progress of trading creative goods and services which resulted in unemployment.
          Most of the economy depends on freelancers which numbered four times more than those
          formally employed. This poses a challenge to promote the creative economy because of its
          setbacks from the COVID-19. The adoption of digitalization could improve the creative economy
          by promoting technical innovation, boosting digital infrastructure, and facilitating digital
          transformation in associated industries. Despite the adoption of technology, to avoid mass
          unemployment it is critical to cultivate creative abilities that cannot be replaced by technology.
          The movement to digitalization would have high costs as the equipment itself is expensive given
          how relatively new they are, although the concept of digitalization has been in progress for
          some decades meaning multiple companies developed and are developing a multitude of
          products which can aid the movement to digitalization
